## Introduction

**nf-core/pixelator** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for analysis of Molecular Pixelation assays.
It takes a samplesheet as input and will process your data using `pixelator` to produce final antibody counts.

![](./docs/images/nf-core-pixelator-metromap.svg)

1. Build amplicon from input reads ([`pixelator amplicon`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
2. Read QC and filtering, correctness of the pixel binding sequence sequences ([`pixelator preqc | pixelator adapterqc`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
3. Assign a marker (barcode) to each read ([`pixelator demux`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
4. Error correction, duplicate removal, compute read counts ([`pixelator collapse`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
5. Compute the components of the graph from the edge list in order to create putative cells ([`pixelator graph`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
6. Call and annotate cells ([`pixelator annotate`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
7. Analyze the cells for polarization and colocalization ([`pixelator analysis`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
8. Report generation ([`pixelator report`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))

> [!WARNING]
> Since Nextflow 23.07.0-edge, Nextflow no longer mounts the host's home directory when using Apptainer or Singularity.
> This causes issues in some dependencies. As a workaround, you can revert to the old behavior by setting the environment variable
> `NXF_APPTAINER_HOME_MOUNT` or `NXF_SINGULARITY_HOME_MOUNT` to `true` in the machine from which you launch the pipeline.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,design,panel,fastq_1,fastq_2
uropod_control,D21,human-sc-immunology-spatial-proteomics,uropod_control_300k_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz,uropod_control_300k_S1_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a sample and gives the design, a panel file and the input fastq files.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/pixelator \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
For more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the
[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/output).
